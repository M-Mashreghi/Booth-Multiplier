# Booth Multiplier

A 5 bit booth multiplier implemented with verilog.

Booth's multiplication algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies two signed binary numbers in two's complement notation. The algorithm was invented by Andrew Donald Booth in 1950 while doing research on crystallography at Birkbeck College in Bloomsbury, London.[1] Booth's algorithm is of interest in the study of computer architecture.
